# tf-virtual-bg

Eventually this will be a Python script to make a mask that can be used in OBS to remove backgrounds, similarly to Zoom's virtual background feature. For now this is basically an empty repo.

To contribute, you'll probably want to download the TFLite interpreter from [this link.](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)
